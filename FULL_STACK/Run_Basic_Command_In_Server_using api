//using curl command get method and query string we are running command in our surver 

every  api has own work ,agr apko apne endpoint ya api tak jaana hai kaafi ways hai 1st: curl cmd ke through query string and 2nd through form 


cd /var/www/html

<form method =GET action =" http://ip/cgi-bin/cmd.py " >
Enter ur cmd </input name=c>

<input type=submit>
</form>

u can only run basic command through this not advance i.e system level or root level not possible : 

client -->request---->webserver (program/process) 

every process ahs its own process/privelage/depends on which account it is connected and run because of power . 
eg. in linux 
systemctl status httpd  //apache program is running in bg 
ps -aux (show u all process name ) //will show http name process run due to apache user power 

that is why due to pache user u are doing limited tasks . as due to apache webserver only our program is running in background, as it has limited power so u cannot do advance .

give whoami in your form u will get apache . 
to do some adavnce work u have to give extra power to user . 
we have sudo i.e vim etc/sudoers

apache ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL


now run advance commands like useradd  in form : but it is advance comamnd so add sudo in beggining 

in cat/etc/passwd u cansee new account is created 


now we have to put sudo again nd again so directly add sudo in python file 
output = subprocess.getoutput("sudo " + cmd) 

//so u can launch docker and start docker and see iamge and launch in background and check 

task : create a app in mobile phone to launch docker .
