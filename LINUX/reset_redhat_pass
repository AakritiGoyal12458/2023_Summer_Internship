The command "ls -l -Z /etc/shadow" is used to list detailed information about the `/etc/shadow` file in Linux, including the security context of the file.

Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `ls`: The command to list files and directories.
- `-l`: A command-line option to display detailed information about files, including permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps.
- `-Z`: A command-line option to display the security context of the file. This is typically used in SELinux-enabled systems to show the SELinux security context of the file.

`/etc/shadow` is a critical file in Linux that stores encrypted user passwords. It is readable only by the root user or users with administrative privileges. The command `ls -l -Z /etc/shadow` allows you to view the file's permissions, ownership, size, timestamps, and security context, providing valuable information about the security settings and access restrictions on the file.
